This is a Titanium Plugin Project which allows you to extend the capabilities of the 
Titanium compiler.

Run `build.py` to build and package your plugin.  You can then copy the zip file into 
to you Titanium distribution directory (for example, `/Library/Application Support/Titanium`).

You then reference your plugin in the application `tiapp.xml` file such as:

    <plugins>
        <plugin version="0.1">com.github.nowelium.titanium.plugin.androidmanifest</plugin>
    </plugins>
    

You can also add your plugin directly to your project. Copy your `plugin.py` to the directory
`$PROJECT_DIR/plugins/com.github.nowelium.titanium.plugin.androidmanifest/`.  You still need to reference your plugin in the
`tiapp.xml` above.
